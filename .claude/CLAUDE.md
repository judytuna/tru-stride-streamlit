> let's migrate to supabase!

⏺ Great! Let's migrate to Supabase. This will give you persistent storage and proper authentication.

⏺ Step 1: Set up Supabase project

  First, you'll need to:
  1. Go to and create a free account
  2. Create a new project
  3. Get your project credentials

  Once you have those, I'll help you integrate them. Can you:

  1. Create a Supabase account and project
  2. Go to Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard
  3. Copy these values:
    - Project URL
    - Anon public key (the public key, not the service role key)

  While you do that, let me start preparing the code migration:
  ...
   Perfect! I've successfully migrated your Streamlit app from SQLite to Supabase. Here's what's been completed:

  ✅ Migration Complete!

  What I've done:

  1. Replaced SQLite with Supabase - All database functions now use Supabase
  2. Updated authentication - Now uses Supabase Auth with proper email/password flow
  3. Added requirements - Added supabase to requirements.txt
  4. Created setup guide - Comprehensive SUPABASE_SETUP.md with step-by-step instructions

  Key changes:

  - Login now uses email instead of username
  - Automatic profile creation when users sign up
  - Admin users are created from environment variables
  - Persistent storage - no more database loss on app restarts
  - JSON storage for analysis results (more flexible than string storage)

  Next Steps:

  1. Follow the setup guide in SUPABASE_SETUP.md:
    - Create Supabase project
    - Run the SQL to create tables
    - Get your credentials
    - Update Streamlit secrets
  2. Admin login will be:
    - Email: admin@example.com
    - Password: Your ADMIN_PASSWORD from secrets
    - Email: epona01@example.com
    - Password: Your EPONA01_PASSWORD from secrets

  The migration preserves all your existing functionality while providing persistent, scalable storage. Your users will need to re-register since
  we're moving to a new database system, but admins will be automatically created from environment variables.
